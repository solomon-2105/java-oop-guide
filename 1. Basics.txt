ðŸ“„ Basics.java

// Basic skeleton for a Java program
class Basics {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Sinai!");
    }
}


ðŸ”§ How to Run It

1. Go to terminal and type:
   javac Basics.java

   ðŸŸ¢ Here, the Java compiler will compile the code into bytecode.  
   If there are no errors in conversion, command prompt will take you to the next line.

2. Now type:
   java Basics

   ðŸš€ Here, JVM will run the bytecode and execute the program.


ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts

âœ… Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class  
ðŸ‘‰ And the class name must be the same as the file name


ðŸ”‘ Main Method  
Any code inside the main method will be executed.

    public static void main(String[] args)


ðŸ’¡ System.out.println  
- System is a built-in class in Java that contains the out object
- out is short for output and is used to print
- print and println are the same, but println adds a new line
