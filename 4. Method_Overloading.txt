Method Overloading:

= Multiple methods having same names with different parameters

code example:
public class Main{
    static int Janj(int x, int y){
        return x+y;
    }
    static double Janj(double a, double b){
        return a+b;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int a = Janj(100,200);
        double b = Janj(12.5,15.5);
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(b);
    }
}

= Multiple methods can have same name as long as the number and/or type of parameters are different

Java Scope:

= In Java, variables are only accessible inside the region they're created. This is called Scope.

= Method Scope:
Variables declared directly inside a method are available anywhere in the method.

code example:
public class Main{
    public static void main(String []args){
        // code here cannot use x

        int x = 100;

        // code here can use x
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}

Recursion (Tiny Peek Only):

= Technique of making a function call itself repeatedly until a base condition is met

= For example: adding 2 numbers together is easy to do but adding a range of numbers is more complicated

code example:
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int result = sum(10);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
    public static int sum(int k){
        if (k > 0) return k + sum(k - 1);
        else return 0;
    }
}
